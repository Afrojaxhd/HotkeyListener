**HotkeyListener** is a .NET library that allows registering system-wide hotkeys that can be used to trigger features in .NET applications. It also provides support for enabling standard Windows and User controls to select hotkeys at runtime.

# Installation

To install via the [NuGet Package Manager](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HotkeyListener/) Console, run:

> `Install-Package HotkeyListener`

# Features
- Supports [.NET Framework 4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718) and higher.
- Manages system-wide hotkeys in a crud-like fashion using the methods `Add`, `Update`, `Remove` and `RemoveAll`. You can also suspend and resume using hotkeys using the methods `Suspend` and `Resume`.
- Determines the pressed hotkey(s) using the `HotkeyPressed` event and its `Hotkey` argument.
- Determines the application from which a hotkey was pressed using the  `HotkeyPressed` event's `SourceApplication` argument.
- In addition to hotkey-listening, the `HotkeySelector` class lets you enable any control to be used for selecting hotkeys at runtime. `HotkeyListener` would be pretty much half-baked if this class wasn't available, and thus the need for it. This will be super handy for applications that let end-users choose their own preferred hotkey(s) for certain features to be invoked/launched.
- As a nifty addition to this library, `HotkeyListener` includes a helper method, `GetSelection`, which lets you get the text selected in any active application from where a hotkey was pressed. To get a glimpse of what's possible with this feature, think of how [WordWeb]( https://wordweb.info/free/ ) is able to lookup the definition of any phrase you've selected at the press of a hotkey... Or how [Cintanotes]( http://cintanotes.com/ ) lets you save highlighted texts as notes from any active application in an instant. That's precisely what you can achieve with `HotkeyListener`.

# Usage

### Adding Hotkeys

First, ensure you import the library's namespace:

```c#
using WK.Libraries.HotkeyListenerNS;
```

...then instantiate the class and add some hotkeys:

```c#
var hkl = new HotkeyListener();

hkl.Add("Control+Shift+E");
hkl.Add("Alt+X");
```

The `Add()` method also allows adding an array of hotkeys at once:

```c#
// An array of hotkeys.
string[] hotkeys = { "Control+Shift+E", "Alt+X" };

hkl.Add(hotkeys);
```

> **Important:** If you're building an application that has no external user-option for changing or customizing the default hotkey(s) set, something you'll need to consider when working with global hotkeys is that there are a number of predefined keys or key combinations already in use within a number of applications such as [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com) - for example, `Control+Tab`. This then means that you may need to find the right key or key combination to use when shipping your applications.

### Listening to Hotkeys

To listen to key presses, use the `HotkeyPressed` event:

```c#
// Define our hotkeys.
string[] hotkeys = { "Control+Shift+E", "Alt+X" };

// Add our hotkeys.
hkl.Add(new[] { hotkey1, hotkey2 });

// Add a HotkeyPressed event.
hkl.HotkeyPressed += Hkl_HotkeyPressed;

private void Hkl_HotkeyPressed(object sender, HotkeyEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Hotkey == hotkey1)
        MessageBox.Show("First hotkey was pressed.");
    
    if (e.Hotkey == hotkey2)
        MessageBox.Show("Second hotkey was pressed.");
}
```

Unlike with the `KeyDown` or `KeyUp` events, here only the registered hotkeys will be detected.

If you'd like to get the details of the active application where a hotkey was pressed, simply use the `SourceApplication` argument property:

```c#
private void Hkl_HotkeyPressed(object sender, HotkeyEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Hotkey == hotkey2)
    {
    	MessageBox.Show(
            "Application:" + e.SourceApplication.Name + "\n" +
            "Title: " + e.SourceApplication.Title + "\n" +
            "ID: " + e.SourceApplication.ID + "\n" +
            "Handle: " + e.SourceApplication.Handle + "\n" +
            "Path: " + e.SourceApplication.Path + "\n"
        );
    }
}
```

As a special feature, if you'd like to get any text that may have been selected when a hotkey added was pressed, use Hotkey Listener's `GetSelection()` method:

```c#
private void Hkl_HotkeyPressed(object sender, HotkeyEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Hotkey == hotkey2)
    {
        // Get the selected text, if any.
        string selection = hkl.GetSelection();
    	
        // If some text was selected, 
        // display a message box.
        if (selection != string.Empty)
            MessageBox.Show(selection);
    }
}
```

### Updating Hotkeys

You can update hotkeys using the `Update()` method. It works the same way as *string replacement* where you provide the current string and its replacement option:

```c#
hkl.Update("Control+Shift+E", "Control+Alt+E");
```

Hotkey updates can occur even while the application is running. **However**, something important you need to note is **always use variables to store hotkeys** since in this way, whenever an update to the hotkey occurs, it will automatically be detected in the `HotkeyPressed` event. 

Here's what I mean:

```c#
string myHotkey = "Control+Shift+E";

// To update our hotkey, simply pass the current hotkey 
// with a ref keyword to the variable and its replacement.
hkl.Update(ref myHotkey, "Control+Alt+E");
```

This will ensure that both the hotkey and its variable have been updated to reflect the changes made. This design is especially handy if your application saves *user settings* after update.

Here's another classical example of updating a hotkey:

```c#
string hotkey1 = "Control+Shift+E";
string hotkey2 = "Alt+E";

// Once we reference the variable hotkey1, this will 
// update the hotkey and listen for its key-presses.
hkl.Update(ref hotkey1, hotkey2);
```

### Removing Hotkeys

To remove a hotkey, we use the `Remove()` method. This method has two variants:

>`Remove()`: This accepts a *single* hotkey or an *array* of hotkeys.
>
>`RemoveAll()`: This removes all the registered hotkeys.

Below are two examples:

```c#
// Our main registered hotkey.
string hotkey1 = "Control+Shift+E";

// Remove the hotkey.
hkl.Remove(hotkey1);

// Our array of registered hotkeys.
string[] hotkeys = { "Control+Shift+E", "Control+Shift+X", "Alt+P" };

// Remove the hotkeys.
hkl.Remove(hotkeys);
```

```c#
// Removes all registered hotkeys.
hkl.RemoveAll();
```

### Suspending/Resuming Hotkeys

**Suspending** hotkeys refers to *disabling* or *deactivating* the hotkeys while **resuming** refers to *enabling* or *reactivating* the hotkeys for continued use. 

These two methods are very applicable when a user desires to choose another hotkey from a currently active hotkey. *What do I mean?* We'll let us imagine we have two hotkeys `Control+Shift+E` and `Alt+X`, but the user desires to change `Control+Shift+E` to `Alt+X` and `Alt+X` to something else. In this case, we cannot modify a hotkey to another hotkey if the hotkeys added are currently active. *So what do we do?* We first of all need to **suspend** the hotkeys to prevent from listening to key-presses, change the desired hotkey, then **resume** listening to the hotkeys having made the necessary changes:

```c#
string hotkey1 = "Control+Shift+E";
string hotkey1 = "Alt+X";

// Suspend all registered hotkeys.
hkl.Suspend();

// Update hotkeys to newer keys.
hkl.Update(ref hotkey1, "Alt+X");
hkl.Update(ref hotkey1, "Alt+P");

// Resume listening to the hotkeys.
hkl.Resume();
```

Let's find out more on how to work with this feature using the `HotkeySelector` class.

### The `HotkeySelector` Class

As noted earlier, `HotkeyListener` would have been pretty much half-baked had the ability to provide hotkey selection not been there. That's the whole intention of this class. It is able to convert any control into an actual hotkey selector for usage at runtime.

Here's a preview of an application using this feature:
