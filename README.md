**HotkeyListener** is a .NET library that allows registering system-wide hotkeys that can be used to trigger features in .NET applications. It also provides support for enabling standard Windows and User controls to select hotkeys at runtime.

# Installation

To install via the [NuGet Package Manager](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HotkeyListener/) Console, run:

> `Install-Package HotkeyListener`

# Features
Here's a comprehensive list of the features available:

- Supports [.NET Framework 4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718) and higher.
- Manages system-wide hotkeys in a crud-like fashion using the methods `Add`, `Update`, `Remove` and `RemoveAll`. You can also suspend and resume using hotkeys using the methods `Suspend` and `Resume`.
- Determines the pressed hotkey(s) using the `HotkeyPressed` event and its `Hotkey` argument.
- Determines the application from which a hotkey was pressed using the  `HotkeyPressed` event's `SourceApplication` argument.
- In addition to hotkey-listening, the `HotkeySelector` class lets you enable any control to be used for selecting hotkeys at runtime. `HotkeyListener` would be pretty much half-baked if this class wasn't available, and thus the need for it. This will be super handy for applications that let end-users choose their own preferred hotkey(s) for certain features to be invoked/launched.
- As a nifty addition to this library, `HotkeyListener` includes a helper method, `GetSelection`, which lets you get the text selected in any active application from where a hotkey was pressed. To get a glimpse of what's possible with this feature, think of how [WordWeb]( https://wordweb.info/free/ ) is able to lookup the definition of any phrase you've selected at the press of a hotkey... Or how [Cintanotes]( http://cintanotes.com/ ) lets you save highlighted texts as notes from any active application in an instant. That's precisely what you can achieve with `HotkeyListener`.

# Usage

### Adding Hotkeys

First, ensure you import the library's namespace:

```c#
using WK.Libraries.HotkeyListenerNS;
```

...then instantiate the class, add some hotkeys:

```c#
var hkl = new HotkeyListener();

hkl.Add("Control+Shift+E");
hkl.Add("Alt+X");
```

The `Add()` method also allows adding an array of hotkeys at once:

```c#
// An array of hotkeys.
string[] hotkeys = { "Control+Shift+E", "Alt+X" };

hkl.Add(hotkeys);
```

> **Important:** If you're building an application that has no external user-option for changing or customizing the default hotkey(s) set, something you'll need to consider when working with global hotkeys is that there are a number of predefined keys or key combinations already in use within a number of applications such as [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com) - for example, `Control+Tab`. This then means that you may need to find the right key or key combination to use when shipping your applications.

### Listening to Hotkey Presses

Now to listen to key presses, use the `HotkeyPressed` event:

```c#
string[] hotkeys = { "Control+Shift+E", "Alt+X" };
hkl.Add(new[] { hotkey1, hotkey2 });

hkl.HotkeyPressed += Hkl_HotkeyPressed;

private void Hkl_HotkeyPressed(object sender, HotkeyEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Hotkey == hotkey1)
        MessageBox.Show("First hotkey was pressed.");
    if (e.Hotkey == hotkey2)
        MessageBox.Show("Second hotkey was pressed.");
}
```

If you'd like to get the details of the active application where a hotkey was pressed, simply use the `SourceApplication` argument property:

```c#
private void Hkl_HotkeyPressed(object sender, HotkeyEventArgs e)
{
	if (e.Hotkey == hotkey2)
    {
    	MessageBox.Show(
            "Application:" + e.SourceApplication.Name + "\n" +
            "Title: " + e.SourceApplication.Title + "\n" +
            "ID: " + e.SourceApplication.ID + "\n" +
            "Handle: " + e.SourceApplication.Handle + "\n" +
            "Path: " + e.SourceApplication.Path + "\n"
        );
    }
}
```

As a special feature, if you'd like to get any text that may have been selected when a hotkey you added was pressed, use Hotkey Listener's `GetSelection()` method:

```c#
private void Hkl_HotkeyPressed(object sender, HotkeyEventArgs e)
{
	if (e.Hotkey == hotkey2)
    {
        string selection = hkl.GetSelection();
    	
        if (selection != string.Empty)
            MessageBox.Show(selection);
    }
}
```

### Updating Hotkeys

You can update hotkeys using the `Update()` method. It works the same way as *string replacement* where you provide the current string and its replacement option:

```c#
hkl.Update("Control+Shift+E", "Control+E");
```

Hotkey updates can occur even while the application is running. **However**, something important you need to note is **always use variables to store hotkeys** since in this way, whenever an update to the hotkey occurs, it will automatically be detected in the `HotkeyPressed` event. 

Here's what I mean:

```c#
// Let's define our hotkey.
string myHotkey = "Control+Shift+E";

// Let's add a HotkeyPressed event.
hkl.HotkeyPressed += (senderObject, eventArgs) => 
{
    if (e.Hotkey == myHotkey)
        MessageBox.Show("My hotkey was pressed.");
}

// To update our hotkey, simply pass the current hotkey 
// with a ref keyword to the variable and its replacement.
hkl.Update(ref myHotkey, "Control+E");
```

This will ensure that both the hotkey and its variable have been updated to reflect the changes made. This design is especially handy if your application saves *user settings* after update.

Here's another classical example of updating a hotkey:

```c#
string hotkey1 = "Control+Shift+E";
string hotkey2 = "Control+E";

// Since we'll reference hotkey1, this will update hotkey1 
// and its variable using a reference to hotkey2's value.
hkl.Update(ref hotkey1, ref hotkey2);
```

### Removing Hotkeys

To remove a hotkey, we use the `Remove()` method. This method has two variants:

>`Remove()`: This accepts a *single* hotkey or an *array* of hotkeys.
>
>`RemoveAll()`: This removes all the registered hotkeys.

Below are two examples:

```c#
// Our main registered hotkey.
string hotkey1 = "Control+Shift+E";

// Remove the hotkey.
hkl.Remove(hotkey1);

// Our array of registered hotkeys.
string[] hotkeys = { "Control+Shift+E", "Control+Shift+X", "Alt+P" };

// Remove the hotkeys.
hkl.Remove(hotkeys);
```

```c#
// This removes all the registered hotkeys.
hkl.RemoveAll();
```
